DataPredict™ Axon is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created as a direct upgrade to the [DataPredict™ Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

## Currently Known Bugs

* The non-fast versions of the pooling layers, convolution layers and the cost functions have an issue where the first derivative tensor cannot be calculated properly. This is due to the automatic differentiation tensor does not handle stored scalar values properly.
