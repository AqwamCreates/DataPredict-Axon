DataPredict™ Axon is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created as a direct upgrade to the [DataPredict™ Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).
