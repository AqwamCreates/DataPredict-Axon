# Release 1.2.0

## ReinforcementLearningModels

* This section is added.

## RecurrentModels

* This section is added.

## AutomaticDifferentiationTensor

* Indexing an "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" with a number will construct "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" for the sub-tensor.

* Added coerce() and stack() constructors.

* Added getDimensionSizeArray() function.

* Fixed a strange firstDerivativeTensor accumulation behaviour.

## Convolution

* Added Convolution1D, Convolution2D and Convolution3D under "ConvolutionLayers" section.

## WeightContainer

* The new() constructor no longer accepts WeightTensorDataArray. Use setWeightTensorDataArray() function instead.

## CostFunctions

* Made some internal changes.

## ActivationLayers

* Made some internal changes.

## ConvolutionLayers

* Made some internal changes.

## PaddingLayers

* Made some internal changes.

## DropoutLayers
