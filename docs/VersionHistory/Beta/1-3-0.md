# Beta 1.3.0

## Added

* Added enableFirstDerivativeCalculation(), disableFirstDerivativeCalculation() and disableFirstDerivativeCalculationForNextTensor() flags under "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" section. This controls whether or not to create first derivative functions upon the automatic differentiation tensor creation that is required for backpropagation.
