# Beta 1.1.0

# Added

* Added "ReinforcementLearningModels" and "RecurrentModels" sections.

* Added Convolution1D, Convolution2D and Convolution3D under "ConvolutionLayers" section.

* Added coerce() and stack() constructors under "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" section.

* Added getDimensionSizeArray() function under "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" section.

## Changes

* The new() constructor no longer accepts WeightTensorDataArray under "WeightContainer". Use setWeightTensorDataArray() function instead.

* Indexing an "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" with a number will construct "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" for the sub-tensor.

* Changed the internals of "CostFunctions", "ActivationLayers", "ConvolutionLayers", "PaddingLayers", "DropoutLayers" and "EncodingLayers".

## Fixes

* Fixed a strange firstDerivativeTensor accumulation behaviour under "AutomaticDifferentiationTensor" section.
